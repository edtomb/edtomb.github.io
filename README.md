## Projects

### Robotics Project
[Read more here!](#)

As part of Ohio State's Fundamentals of Engineering Honors curriculum, I worked on a group robotics project coded in C++ to run on the FEH Proteus. We designed a robot to maneuver a diner-themed course, completing tasks like flipping a burger and changing the jukebox song, using a local positioning system, shaft encoders, and multiple servos. Our robot, assembled from factory parts within a $160 budget, placed in the top 16 out of 65 teams. The project was a collaborative effort with my talented teammates, supported by instructional staff and our dedicated instructor, Paul Clingan.

### Connect 4

Wrote a Connect 4 solver using C++ for the backend and vanilla JavaScript for the frontend, compiled to WebAssembly via Emscripten. Initially, I used a 2-D array and minimax algorithm but later optimized it with a bitboard representation and negamax solver, significantly improving performance. The solver can process thousands of moves per millisecond, providing a strong AI opponent, and is available on my GitHub page.

### Winding Roads

I created a personal project to explore wave function collapse algorithms, resulting in an nxn grid of tiles that fit together like a puzzle. The algorithm uses 5 images in 12 total orientations to generate the grid. You can see examples from a tileset I designed on my GitHub page.

### Pro-Con Bot

This AI-Powered decision maker uses ChatGPT to make a list of pros and cons related to any decision you may have. Just type in a description and you will get a list of pros and cons, as well as detailed insights and questions to help guide your decision making process. *Note that this requires a paid OpenAI plan. Each query costs around 6 cents. You will be prompted to enter an OpenAI API key the first time you use the website.

### Neural Network
[Read more here!](#)

My first dive into deep learning! I built a feed-forward neural network using only Numpy Arrays. I trained it on the MNIST handwritten digits dataset as well as Google's QuickDraw! dataset. The doodle network has been trained to recognize airplanes, tornados, bananas, anvils, doors, apples, cats, brooms, cacti, couches, and fish. The digit network can recognize the numbers 0-9.
